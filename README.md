- 👋 Hi, I’m @gittyboyyo
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and programming, I'm into way more out of the box stuff to though so I don't mind crazy ideas because I believe I have an open enough mind to take creaitve ideas or in some specail cases, dumb ideas and turn em into something new. So feel free to share, although you should expect constructive critisim from not just from me but every other person like me or understands the and accepts the responsibility of being a tech kind of person in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming and coding firat, my plans is to go pro and hopfully do it full-time. Although that's kind of a back-back burner from the buissness I'm currently trying to run, so it's long but I have faith in myself and I truly believe that I'll finally exit this lazy and sloppy state I'm in currently lol. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something specail, but that comes soon.
- 📫 How to reach me would probably be through my e-mail and or text, but please make sure to keep it brief and profeesional as possible.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I sleep alot, lol so if I don't get to you or seem unavailable it's most likey I am but just busy. Until I get like a bot to dig and handle my e-mails this is how it'll be for the time being.
